# Genetic Evolution Simulation

This project simulates the genetic evolution of entities over time. The simulation includes features such as reproduction, random mutations, aging, and death. The entities are displayed on a graphical interface using Pygame.

## Project Structure

- `EntityDef.py`: Defines the `entity` class, which represents an individual entity in the simulation.
- `Main.py`: Contains the main logic for the simulation, including initialization, daily updates, reproduction, and graphical display.

## Requirements

- Python 3.x
- Pygame

## Installation

1. Clone the repository:
    ```sh
    git clone https://github.com/yourusername/genetic-evolution.git
    cd genetic-evolution
    ```

2. Install the required packages:
    ```sh
    pip install pygame
    ```

## Usage

Run the simulation:
```sh
python Main.py
```
